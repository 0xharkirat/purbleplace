purble place game automation using python autogui, tkinter


This is Comfy Cakes from purble place automation bot.

I have used pyautogui module for automating mouse clicks, detecting elements and photos from screen.

I have made simple UI using tkinter module, so that I don't have to write commands in the terminal.
